# Team Profile Generator

## The Motivation

This project motivated me to understand more of backend with node inputs. It was interesting to get objects and make an HTML file out of the answers that were given for this team generator. 

## Challenges

The biggest challenge of this assignment was actually getting the page template to do what was intended. I had issues with parts of the team would accumulate in the HTML and missing some of the answers that were made. Also, it took some time to edit HTML within Javascript. I used bootstrap and was trying to get my generator to look like the mock and I achieved that.
